# What is TurtleGFX?

In a nutshell this library allows to code with 🐢 Turtle Graphics in JavaScript.

TurtleGFX is add-on for [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.
TurtleGFX extends the JavaScript based p5.js library with  Turtle Graphics drawing primitives.

Turtle Graphics is great for both education and creative coding.

When used in education, teachers and educators, usualy find that Turtle Graphics offers a gently introduction to programming to young kids.

In addition, with Turtle Graphics is very good at presenting some advanced concepts such as recursion.

# Features

Library supports two modes:

- *Easy Mode* / *Default turtle mode*. This is the default mode. In this mode users can work directly with the global TurtleGFX API such as: forward(), left(), right(), etc.

- *Multiple turtles mode*. In this mode users can create multiple turtles on the screen ( let turtle = createTurtle(); turtle.forward(); etc. );

The API has been designed to be closely compatible with popular Turtle Graphics libraries from other languages, such as Python / Logo. In this way you can easily port programs from those languages to JavaScript.

For API reference please consult the [turtlegfx.js](lib/turtlegfx.js) code.
